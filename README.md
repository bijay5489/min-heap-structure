# min-heap-structure
• Developed a min-heap structure using both array and tree-based data structures.
• Created the ArrayCompleteTree, which uses an array to represent the tree, enabling efficient access to parent and child elements.
• Constructed the TreeCompleteTree, representing the tree with node-based structures that include pointers to the parent, left, and right children for straightforward navigation.
• Developed algorithms to identify specific nodes within the complete tree.
• Implemented a min-heap using the complete tree structure, employing "re-heapification upward" and "re-heapification downward" methods as outlined in the textbook.
• Established an invariant checker for both the ArrayCompleteTree and TreeCompleteTree configurations.
• Successfully passed all testing for the ArrayCompleteTree and TreeCompleteTree implementations.
• Finalized the MinHeap class with a functional removeMin method, clearing all related tests.
• Performed comprehensive and random testing to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the implemented data structures and algorithms.
